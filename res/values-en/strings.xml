        The game is all about guessing the right word before the man gets hanged! To guess the word you have to try letter by letter. But careful! You can only
        make 6 mistakes. The 7th will make you loose the round, and the person gets hanged.
        \n\nTo choose a letter simply touch the letter of your choice. It will turn red and lock it so you can\'t touch it twice. It will turn red even if it\'s correct letter
        , but it will also show the right letter upon the lines counting the number of letters.
        \n\nIf you want to know your score, have a look at the top of your screen.
        \n\nYou have won the game if you can guess the right word before it is to late for our guy.
